# A ball at the end of a string is revolving uniformly in a horizontal circle of radius 2 meters at constant angular speed 10 rad/s. Determine the magnitude of the linear velocity of a point located: (a) 0.5 meters from the center 
# (b)	1 meter from the center 
# (c)	2 meters from the center 
# Known: Radius (r) = 0.5 meters, 1 meter, 3 meters, The angular speed = 10 radians/second Wanted: The linear velocity 
# Formula: v = r Ï‰ 


r = eval((input("enter raduis: ")))
w = eval((input("enter the angular velocity value: ")))
v = r*w
print("linear velocity is equal to: ", v)
